## Roll back to v0.2

Since this version of the software is operational, I have decided to roll back to this version for the time being. This project has been removed from legacy status and will now continue to receive updates. 

Just as a reminder, this version of the software is capable of:

1. Printing out the fibonacci sequence as a list up to a selected number.
2. Printing out a selected number in the fibonacci sequence.

I will attempt to comment out this code and update it in smaller bits in order to prevent further meltdowns.

I will breathe new life into this project and am sorry for any annoyance it's failure may have caused.

### note:
there are so many bugs and I don't know what is going on, so I am going to end this project, and maybe create a new one that does the same thing but with better conventions so we don't have this problem again. I have turned this into a legacy project :(

If you have any ideas on how to fix this code please let me know

This note however is just for the time being and I may change my mind in the future
